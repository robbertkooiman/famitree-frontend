## Things to look for

Inside of the /src folder, the code structure for this project can be seen. Most surrounding files are generated.

The .ts files are the TypeScript files, which is where the component logic is made. These are the files that are commented. The HTML-files might be interesting to take a look at too, but as they don't house any logic they have not been commented.
